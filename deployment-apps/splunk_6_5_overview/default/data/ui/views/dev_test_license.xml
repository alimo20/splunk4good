        <p>Below are some common questions; please <strong><a href="https://www.splunk.com/en_us/resources/personalized-dev-test-licenses/faq.html">Please see the FAQ for more information</a></strong>.</p>

<br></br>

        <h2>What is a Personal Use Dev/Test Software License?</h2>
            Splunk customers can now acquire personalized Dev/Test licenses for internal, non-production use. Each license is limited to 50GB/day and a six-month term. The program enables individual users within your organization to experiment with new data sources, as well as encourage others in the organization to try out the Splunk platform in a frictionless manner.

        <h2>How can I get a personalized Dev/Test software license?</h2>
            Customers should go to <strong><a href="www.splunk.com/dev-test">www.splunk.com/dev-test</a></strong> to register. The Dev/Test License key will be delivered via email a short time later.

        <h2>Why is Splunk doing this?</h2>
            We are making it simple for anyone in your organization to use Splunk Enterprise to experiment with new data sources and use cases without impacting your production license capacity. It’s an easy way to explore how you can get more from your data and your investment in Splunk.

            This offer is open to all customers with active support contracts. While we intend to make this a permanent program, we reserve the right to cancel the offer in the future.

<h2>Do I need to upgrade to Splunk Enterprise 6.5 in order to get the new capability?</h2>
You do not need to upgrade your production Splunk Enterprise systems. However, the Dev/Test License is compatible only with Splunk Enterprise 6.5 or greater, so your Dev/Test system itself must be on the appropriate version. Install Splunk Enterprise 6.5 or greater on the designated Dev/Test system before you attempt to use the Dev/Test License key. Attempting to use a Dev/Test License with an older version of Splunk Enterprise will result in an error stating the key is unrecognized.

<h2>What are the limits of use for Dev/Test Licenses?</h2>
Dev/Test is a limited feature set license of Splunk Enterprise software that is only meant for non-production use. The Dev/Test environment cannot be run to make production decisions or for production visibility. The exact definition can be found in Splunk’s standard EULA:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>EULA #2.3 Test and Development Software.</strong> If the applicable Order specifies that any Software is provided under a test and development license, then subject to Customer’s compliance with this Agreement, Splunk grants to Customer a nonexclusive, worldwide, nontransferable, nonsublicensable license during the applicable Term to install and use the Test and Development Software within the Licensed Capacity in a non-production system used for software product migration testing, software product pre-production staging, testing new data sources, types or use cases, or other non-production use. In no way should the Test and Development Software be used for any revenue generation, commercial activity or other productive business or purpose. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Splunk does not provide warranty (Section 10), or indemnification (Section 13) with respect to the Test and Development Software.
          </li>
        </ul>


<h2>Where can I deploy a Dev/Test License?</h2>
You can deploy Dev/Test software anywhere on-premises or by using an independent cloud service such as AWS. A Dev/Test License cannot be used in Splunk Cloud.

<h2>Is there a minimum purchase to qualify for this personalized Dev/Test License offer?</h2>
No, there is no minimum purchase requirement for either Splunk Enterprise or Splunk Cloud. The only requirement is that your licenses are covered by active support contracts or an active Splunk Cloud subscription.

<h2>Do these personalized Dev/Test Licenses include support?</h2>
No. Users can access community support via <strong><a href="www.splunk.com/community">www.splunk.com/community</a></strong>.

<h2>How many personalized Dev/Test Licenses can a company or individual have?</h2>
Each license is assigned to the specific individual / user who requested the license within the customer organization. A user may only have one active personalized Dev/Test License at a time (you may renew every six months if desired).

There is no limit to the number of users who can take advantage of this personalized license in your organization.


<h2>What are the software feature and deployment limitations in the personalized Dev/Test License?</h2>
Each license is valid for up to 50 GB daily data ingestion and a six-month renewable term. Several features are limited in the personalized Dev/Test License, including:
        <ul>
          <li>Support for one authenticated account</li>
          <li>Single node</li>
          <li>No clustering</li>
          <li>No distributed search</li>
        </ul>


<p>These licenses are personalized based on a new identifier in license files, and personalized Dev/Test Licenses within the same organization cannot be stacked together. Personalized Dev/Test Licenses also cannot be stacked with regular Splunk Enterprise licenses or non-personalized Dev/Test Licenses.</p>
<p>If you do not want to accept these limitations because you are testing to move to production in the near term, you can contact your Splunk sales rep or Splunk authorized partner about purchasing a non-feature limited, larger capacity Dev/Test License.</p>
