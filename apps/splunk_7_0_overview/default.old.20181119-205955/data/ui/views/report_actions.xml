          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>Splunk Enterprise v6.3 introduced custom alert actions, opening the door for both third-party as well as enterprise developers to build alert action connectors to other applications, automating critical workflows and gaining operational efficiencies.  In prior releases, this capability was restricted only to alerts, but based on customer demand, has now been integrated into the report scheduler.</p>

          <p>All installed and enabled alert actions are now available to users for both alerts and reports.</p>
